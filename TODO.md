- [ ] Plugins updates
    - [ ] Create aliases for each plugin type
    - [ ] Create scaffolding for each plugin type and allow UI to select plugin for creation
    - [ ] Migrate some plugins to separate repo
    - [ ] Display version, author, description in UI

- [ ] Need to update hdf5 `Dataset` class to accept length or unlimited (since we'll need to write scalars later)
- [ ] Add saving of protocol data to hdf5 file
    - protocol
    - graphics settings
    - start time
    - etc.
- [ ] Add logging to plugins
    - [ ] Need to install spdlog globally
    - [ ] Create global mt spdlog sink
    - [ ] Create nng sink which uses the publisher to send json with topic log
    - [ ] Add hooks to plugins
    - [ ] Add tab in reyer_app to view these logs (separate from the app logs or remove app logs?)
- [ ] Add mechanism for recording events for each plugin
    - [ ] Add template parameter for an enum class
    - [ ] Use magic enum library to reflect enum and register as hdf5 type
    - [ ] expose public protected function (maybe something like `recordEvent`) which will write to hdf5 (std::async?) with timestamp
        - [ ] For render plugin we can have default enum which will have basic things like TRIAL_START, TRIAL_END, etc.
    - [ ] Another method for storing other data (templated). has to have type trait defined. maybe `recordCustom(string, value)` with internal `map<string, Dataset<T>`?

- [ ] App should wait for graphics/plugin manager ready before querying the monitors and plugins
- [ ] Send graphics and pipeline together to avoid window showing up during runtime configuration

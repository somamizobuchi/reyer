# Reyer repository
This repository contains the source code for Reyer core library, Reyer runtime executable, and the Reyer application (written in python).

# What is Reyer?
Reyer is library and runtime for conducting psychophysical eye-tracking experiments with Raylib graphics library as the main interface. More specifically, this is software created specifically for use with the DDPI system. However, adapting to your needs (e.g. other eye trackers) may be as simple as changing a few datatypes.

Reyer is designed with modularity in mind.
